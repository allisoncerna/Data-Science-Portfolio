# Data-Science-Portfolio
Data Science &amp; Analytics Portfolio | End-to-end projects featuring automated data ingestion (Kaggle API), financial time-series forecasting in Python, and corporate profitability analysis using SQL and Tableau

This portfolio provides an in-depth look at the projects listed on my resume. While my resume highlights the core business impact, these repositories document the technical architecture, SQL queries, and Python logic used to drive those insights.

## Project 1: Personal Finance Optimizer (Python/ML)

* **The In-Depth Reality:** While my resume highlights 800+ transactions, this repository showcases my ability to scale that logic to **32,000+ records** via the Kaggle API to simulate a fintech production environment.
* **The Technical Solution:**
    * **Automated ETL:** Built a Python pipeline to ingest, clean, and audit high-volume financial data.
    * **Predictive Modeling:** Applied **Time-Series Forecasting** to predict future monthly surplus based on recurring billing cycles and seasonal trends.
    * **Leak Detection:** Engineered logic to isolate non-essential "spending leaks" and discretionary income patterns.
* **Key Tech:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn), Matplotlib/Seaborn, Kaggle API.

## Project 2: Corporate Profitability & Margin Optimization (SQL/Tableau)
* **The In-Depth Reality:** To showcase a wider technical range, I expanded this project into a **"Bi-Platform" BI analysis**, ensuring 100% metric consistency between **Tableau** and **Power BI** using a unified MySQL backend.
* **The Technical Solution:**
    * **Relational Database Design:** Architected a MySQL database to handle multi-brand retail records, handling currency and missing data inconsistencies.
    * **KPI Engineering:** Utilized **Advanced SQL (CTEs & Window Functions)** to calculate Net Margin, ROI, and "Return-to-Revenue" ratios.
    * **Executive Reporting:** Deployed a geographic deep-dive in Tableau and a high-level KPI scorecard in Power BI to support data-driven inventory decisions.
* **Key Tech:** SQL (MySQL), Tableau, Power BI, Data Modeling.
